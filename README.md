#Merchant of the Six Kingdoms Localization

This is an informal repo for sharing language data for the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms video game. The included files contain the vast majority of the dialgoue and other language data. There are some parts like static UI and programmatic dialogue that will need to be done manually, but if I'm provided a mostly complete localization of the included files, I'll be happy to help finish those last parts. I can include the localization directly in the game or provide an import tool in game, whatever is preferred by the contributors.

Please reach out on the Github Issues tab, or alternatively the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms community page on Steam. Please do not use this repo or the Steam forums to solicit for paid localization work.
