#Merchant of the Six Kingdoms Localization

This is a repo for providing the files to localize the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms video game for anyone interested in submitting a localization. The included files contain the vast majority of the dialgoue and other language data. There are some parts like static UI and programmatic dialogue that will need to be done manually, but if I'm provided a mostly complete localization of the included files, I'll be happy to help finish those last parts.

Do not translate item name or tags contained inside any `bias` or `obtainableItems` properties. Tags are instead mapped through the `localization_mapping.json` file.

Please reach out on the Github Issues tab, or alternatively the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms community page on Steam. Please do not use this repo or the Steam forums to solicit for paid localization work.
