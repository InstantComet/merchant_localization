#Merchant of the Six Kingdoms Localization

This is a repo for providing the files to localize the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms video game for anyone interested in submitting a localization. The included files contain the vast majority of the dialgoue and other language data.

Do not translate item name or tags contained inside any `bias` or `obtainableItems` properties. Tags are instead mapped through the `localization_mapping.json` file.

**Do not use machine translations**

While machine translations can be decent, this game depends more than most on the nuances of language and culture. The game has a high score on Steam and reputation in general so I would like to avoid new players having bad experiences because of misleading or broken translations.

If any questions, please reach out on the Github Issues tab, or alternatively the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms community page on Steam. Please do not use this repo or the Steam forums to solicit for paid localization work.

When you have a finished localization, please reach out to `goosepostbox__at__gmail` or alternatively the Merchant of the Six Kingdoms community page on Steam.
